			KNOWN BUGS


- In the "compose" menu tag a few attachments, and pipe
  them to "less"; there's no way to convince Mutt to pipe
  them as a single file instead of doing that one by one
  (the "attach_split" and "attach_sep" has disappeared).

- In the "attachment" menu, assume this:

	1 [text/plain, 7bit, 1.1K]           <no description>
	2 [message/rfc822, 7bit, 6.1K]       A test message
	3 [text/plain, 7bit, 0.1K]           |-><no description>
	4 [message/rfc822, base64, 2.5K]     |-><no description>
	5 [message/rfc822, base64, 2.7K]     `-><no description>

  (please note the "message/rfc822" attachments encoded as
  Base64; that's illegal, but Sun's Mailtool sends that
  kind of messages); then go to, say, attachment "4",
  delete it, and go to the main menu; you won't be able to
  quit the mailbox (ok, 'x' works, but 'q' doesn't).

  The problem here lies in the fact that mutt uses mailbox
  handling functions to access message/rfc822 type
  attachments.  We'd need to perform an additional
  decoding step before using these functions to fix this
  bug.

- In maildir folders, the cursor will jump to an
  unpredictible message when new mail arrives.

- When accessing maildir folders with two mutts in
  parallel, messages which have been marked read (and thus
  moved to the cur/ subdirectory) by one of the mutts
  can't be read from the other one.

- rfc1524_expand_filename() doesn't work as expected, as
  it doesn't honor $tmpdir under some conditions if
  matching nametemplates exist.
